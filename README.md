# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests - Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Objective
This project demonstrates how to apply tree-based machine learning models, specifically *Decision Trees* and *Random Forests, for binary classification using the **Heart Disease dataset*.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- graphviz (for tree visualization)

---

## 🧪 Dataset
The dataset used is heart.csv, containing patient data to predict the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. *Data Preprocessing*
   - Loaded and split dataset into training and test sets.
   
2. *Decision Tree Classifier*
   - Trained on training data.
   - Visualized using graphviz.
   - Accuracy evaluated and overfitting controlled by adjusting max_depth.

3. *Random Forest Classifier*
   - Trained with 100 estimators.
   - Accuracy compared to Decision Tree.
   - Feature importances plotted.

4. *Cross-Validation*
   - 5-fold cross-validation applied to both models.

## 📊 Results

| Model           | Test Accuracy | CV Mean ± Std      |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Decision Tree    | 97.08%         | 99.71% ± 0.59%       |
| Random Forest    | 98.05%         | 99.41% ± 0.72%       |
